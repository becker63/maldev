## `✋` IMPORTANT
> **Warning**: *I've moved on from creating detailed posts about each of the techniques I've done on this repository. This repo will now just be used to house the source code of the techniques I end up learning about. To read the actual detailed blog posts of each technique, please head over to my new website [here](https://crows-nest.gitbook.io/).*

This repository was created to archive and document all of my attempts to learn and develop malware. I'm brand new to all of this. We'll start from the absolute beginning and see how far we can get. The techniques I'd love to learn are:

- `🟢` [Shellcode Injection](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/shellcode-injection) 
- `🟢` [DLL Injection](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/dll-injection) 
- `🟢` [Using NTDLL](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/ntapi-injection) 
- `🟢` [Full NTDLL Implementation](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/ntapi-injection/complete-ntapi-implementation)
- `🟢` [Using Direct System Calls](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/syscalls/direct-syscalls) 
- `🟢` [Indirect Syscalls](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/inject/syscalls/indirect-syscalls)
- ...

> **Note**:
> *As I come across more stuff, I'll add more to the list. Moreover, as I complete the techniques above, I'll also update this list.*

## `📚` PREREQUISITES
We're going to be dealing with a lot of low-level stuff. As such, it's important to familiarize yourself with languages like `C`, `C++`, `Assembly`, etc. I might create another repository solely for documenting my progression with the aforementioned topics, but that's far back in the pipeline for now.

## `🛑` DISCLAIMER
Obviously, the stuff in this repository is explicitly for educational purposes. Not that you'll be able to run this in a patched environment without getting the absolute sh*t flagged out of it. Regardless, I do not condone the use of these programs for any malicious activities.
